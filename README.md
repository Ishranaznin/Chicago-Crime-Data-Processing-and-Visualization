1. The work is done on Chicago crime data from March 9, 2025, to April 9, 2025.
2. In task 1, I have added the neighborhood information in crime data set. (Chicago_Crime_Visualization.ipynb)
3. In task 2, I used the Folium choropleth map, a python library for interactive geospatial data visualization, to visualize the neighborhood and its total crime number.
4. In task 3, I made a graph of the neighborhoods using KNN, and visualize the result onto the graph from task 3.
5. I have also tried to work on D3 for graph visualization as per your preference.
